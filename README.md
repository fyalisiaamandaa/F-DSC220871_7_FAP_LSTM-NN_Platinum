# Data Science
Platinum challenge for BINAR Bootcamp. 

## Descriptive Analysis for data tweets
This project is an analysis of datset provided by BINAR. The data provided for this report covers the 11.000 tweets and included with the sentiment. 
The senitements are devided into 3 type which are Positive, Negative and Neutral. There are 3436 tweets with negative sentimen, 1148 tweet is neutral and 6415 with sentiment positive. 

## About the project
The objective for this project is to create an API that can be shows the tweets that we input is positive, negative and neutral. 
The other goals are to compare the accuracy value between Neural Network and LSTM. The Neural Network here we use Bag of Word and TF-IDF as an feature extraction and we use word embedding for LSTM. We also create the model for LSTM using Bag of Words and TF-IDF as an feature extraction.
Descriptive analysis of datset also shows in this project.
